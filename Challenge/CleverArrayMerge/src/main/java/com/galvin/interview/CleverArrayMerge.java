/**
 * The goal of this test is to take two arrays of different sizes and merge them 
 * into one, alternating elements from each list.
 * 
 * For example, if you have an array [ 1, 2, 3 ] and another [ "a", "b", "c" ],
 * the merge method would return [ 1, "a", 2, "b", 3, "c" ].
 * 
 * But here's a new wrinkle: the arrays might not be the same length. If one is
 * longer than the other, merge them by taking alternate elements until one
 * array is exhausted, and then just add the remaining elements of the 
 * other array in whatever order you find them.
 * 
 * For example, if you have an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and another 
 * [ "a", "b", "c" ], the merge method would return 
 * [ 1, "a", 2, "b", 3, "c", 4, 5 ].
